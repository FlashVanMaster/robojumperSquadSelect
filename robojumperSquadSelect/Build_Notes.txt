This mod is the source of both the vanilla and the WotC version.
In order to successfully build a WotC version, you need to go into the WotC SrcOrig/Core/Globals.uci macro file and define the following macro like so

	`define WITH_WOTC 1

The presence of this macro is checked at compile time and produces a different script package.
I do not expect anything in the upk files to be required to be saved again with the WotC Editor -- these are only Texture2Ds
